Hi Manya,

As discussed on call, the MIDs provided are not online MIDs, and all transactions will be processed through physical POS (TID). Therefore, all TIDs should ideally cover the required expenses.

However, we noticed that some MID expenses are not covered under the respective TIDs. Could you please confirm if the below TIDs do not belong to the Palladium TID database?
